[Pittsburgh Always Anti-Fascist](https://tinyurl.com/pghalwaysantifascist) is a digital exhibit powered by ArcGIS that I had the pleasure to work on while I interned with the Digital Scholarship Services at the University of Pittsburgh. I explore all the archival materials pertaining to anti-fascist activism that I could find. The exhibit features a narrative drawing the artifacts together, heat-maps to show where the action was happening, images of artifacts, a collaborative HistoryPin board, and more.
