Since late 2022, I have collaborated with live-streamers on The Ministry of Science, a grad student forward live show that discusses science and politics, hosted by Marcus a.k.a. [Homozygoat](https://www.twitch.tv/homozygoat). I facilitate (and occasionally participate in) live debates over core controversies among pro-science and progressive audiences. I come on once a month or so on Tuesday at 9:00 PM EST!
