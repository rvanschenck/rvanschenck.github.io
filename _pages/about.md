### About My Research ###

My research examines reactionary digital publics, cultures, and infrastructures. I am trained in the fields of **rhetoric**, **media studies**, and **cultural studies**. I am fascinated by how ultra-conservative, fascist, and ethno-nationalist ideas foment through Internet subcultures and the platforms that host them. Using **humanistic methods** like discourse analysis, online ethnography, and rhetorical criticism, I investigate the media practices that beget and encourage white supremacist, misogynistic, and antisemitic networks.

For a good sample of my research, check out ["Remaking the World Memetically"](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14791420.2023.2228867) in _Communication and Critical/Cultural Studies._ This paper was awarded the Stephen E. Lucas Debut Publication Award by the National Communication Association in 2024.

I recently completed my dissertation:  _The Reactionary Web: Digital Media and the Reconstitution of White Supremacist Networks after the 'Alt-Right.'_ I explain how the Alt-Right, a reactionary digital network most active from 2014-2017, emerged as a result of the exploitative infrastructure of the Internet. By treating its websites, apps, and communities as artifacts for criticism, I explicate their demise after the "Unite the Right" rally and illustrate how some of its constituent factions have persisted and evolved during a shift toward regulating digital platforms.

### About My Pedagogy ###

I was born and raised in Virginia Beach, in the United States, by two public middle school teachers. Nobody else is more qualified to pass down the most important quality for effective teaching: listening to your students. My students have praised my **critical approach to pedagogy** which prioritizes cultivating confidence for creative knowledge production. I believe in **process-over-product** which I practice through dialogic communication of course objecties and balance between activities, lecture, and discussion.

Besides classroom teaching, I possess years of pedagogical experience as a debate coach at the middle school, high school, and college levels in the United States. I was recognized as an excellent instructor in Applied Persuasion with the Teddy Albiniak Award at the University of Texas at Austin in 2022. Whether we meet in the classroom or the squad room, my students have gone on to speak at the National Eating Disorder Awareness walk and to compete at the highest levels of intercollegiate debate. 

### About My Advocacy ###

I contribute my knowledge, perspective, and expertise to meaningfully improve the state of the Internet and of higher education. In the past, I have advised anti-hate speech platform policy and facilitated workshops against anti-trans discrimination. Feel free to reach out to me via email (rvanschenck at faculty dot ie dot edu) if you have an upcoming event, a policy question, or just want to hear me out!

Although I love to speak at academic conferences, my truest love is _public_ speaking. I bring organic experience as an activist who has spoken at such events as March for Our Lives and North Carolina Trans Pride as well as countless occasions, formal and informal. On campus, off campus, or on a video-conference, I would love to share my passion and perspective at your next event!
