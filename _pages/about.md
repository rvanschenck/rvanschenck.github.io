Reed Van Schenck is a Ph.D candidate in Communication and Rhetoric at the University of Pittsburgh and an assistant debate coach at the William Pitt Debating Union.

### About my Research ###

My research examines **reactionary rhetoric**, **digital media**, and **cultural studies**. I am fascinated by how ultra-conservative, fascist, and ethno-nationalist ideas foment through Internet subcultures and the platforms that host them. Using **humanistic methods** like discourse analysis, online ethnography, and rhetorical criticism, I investigate the media practices that beget and encourage white supremacist, misogynistic, and antisemitic networks.

I am currently working on my dissertation:  _The Reactionary Web: Digital Media and the Reconstitution of White Supremacist Networks after the 'Alt-Right.'_ I explain how the Alt-Right, a U.S. American white nationalist digital network most active from 2014-2017, is better understood as an affinity network rather than a social movement. By treating its websites, apps, and communities as artifacts for rhetorical criticism, I explicate the Alt-Right's demise after the Charlottesville "Unite the Right" rally and illustrate how some of its constituent factions have persisted and evolved in the wake of platform regulation.

### About my Pedagogy ###

I was born and raised in Virginia Beach by two public middle school teachers. Nobody else is more qualified to pass down the most important quality for effective teaching: patience. My students have praised my **accommodating teaching style** that prioritizes transparent communication of course objectives; **process-over-product** design; and **adaptive balancing** between activity, lecture, and discussion.

Besides classroom teaching, I possess years of pedagogical experience as a debate coach at the middle school, high school, and college levels. I was recognized as an excellent instructor in Applied Persuasion with the Teddy Albiniak Award at the University of Texas at Austin in 2022. Whether we meet in the classroom or the squad room, my students have gone on to speak at the National Eating Disorder Awareness walk and to compete at the highest levels of intercollegiate debate. 

### About my Advocacy ###

As one of very few open transgender students during my time at Wake Forest, I developed a **firm committment to cultivating practices which meaningfully improve the lives of marginalized people in higher education**. While in North Carolina, I facilitated Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion workshops for both students and faculty on issues of gender and sexuality, and I advised the development of policy to protect students against predatory anti-trans legislation and against the erosion of Title IX. I have had the opportunity to continue DEI during my graduate appointment by serving on graduate self-governing committees.

Although I love to speak at academic conferences, my truest love is _public_ speaking. I bring organic experience as an activist who has spoken at such events as March for Our Lives and North Carolina Trans Pride as well as countless occasions, formal and informal. On campus, off campus, or on a video-conference, I would love to share my passion and perspective at your next event!
