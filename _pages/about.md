Reed Van Schenck is a Ph.D candidate in Communication and Rhetoric at the University of Pittsburgh and an assistant debate coach at the William Pitt Debating Union.

My research examines reactionary rhetoric, digital media, and cultural studies. From imageboards to live-streams and Twitter feeds to Telegram channels, I am fascinated by how ultra-conservative ideas foment through Internet subcultures and the platforms that host them.

Ever since I first booted up "Warcraft III" when I was five, I have been drawn to computers. I should have known that I was to become an academic: The idea that my digits could manipulate unlimited information, the freest of commodities, was an empowering concept. This fantasy did not last for long. Growing up as a gamer in the 2000's gave me a front-row seat to the proliferation of racist and sexist networks within online subcultures. Today, I apply my deep understanding of the cultures, influencers, platforms, and economies involved in order to investigate why reactionary movements take so eagerly to the Internet.

I am currently working on my dissertation: "The Reactionary Web: Digital Media and the Reconstitution of White Supremacist Networks after the 'Alt-Right.'" I explain how the Alt-Right, a U.S. American white nationalist digital network most active from 2014-2017, is better understood as an affinity network rather than a social movement. By treating its websites, apps, and communities as artifacts for rhetorical criticism, I explicate the Alt-Right's demise after the Charlottesville "Unite the Right" rally and illustrate how its constituent factions have persisted and evolved in the wake of platform regulation.

I received my B.A. from Wake Forest University with a double major in History and Communication. There, I competed on the nationally-ranked policy debate team, co-founded a chapter of the Young Democratic Socialists of America, spoke and organized against anti-transgender bathroom legislation, and helped organize conferences in gender studies and rhetoric.

Since then, I have been pursuing my Ph.D in Pittsburgh while teaching Communication courses, like Public Speaking and Argument, and coaching the debate team. I was recognized as an excellent instructor in Applied Persuasion with the Teddy Albiniak Award at the University of Texas at Austin in 2022. Whether we meet in the classroom or the squad room, my students have gone on to speak at the National Eating Disorder Awareness walk and to compete at the highest levels of intercollegiate debate.
